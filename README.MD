# Memory Game

This is a JavaScript implementation of the classic childrens' "Memory Game".  Players have a grid of cards and must match the cards up by flipping one pair at a time.  This implementation is completely responsive and playable in all modern browsers and devices.

## Stretch Features
This game features the option of an "Easy" (4x4 grid), "Medium" (6x6), or "Hard" (8x8) game board.  Each level has its own star-rating calculation.

## Technologies Used
The game is built with CSS and JavaScript using object-oriented techniques.  [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) is used for templating, and [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) is used as the CSS framework.  

[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) were used as build tools.
